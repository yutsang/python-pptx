Potential under-estimated construction payables and CAPEX commitments may still exist. Management said there was no CAPEX plan at current stage.\"\n}\n            \n            FINANCIAL FIGURE: IP: 197.5M\n            \n            DATA SOURCE: {\n  \"sheet\": \"Investment properties\",\n  \"data\": \"    Unnamed: 0                                Unnamed: 1           Unnamed: 2\\n22         NaN     Investment properties -
