Focus on:\n1. Content generation using patterns from pattern.json\n2. Integration of actual worksheet data into narrative content\n3. Professional financial writing suitable for audit reports\n4. Consistent formatting and structure\n5. Clear, accurate descriptions of financial positions\n6. Replace all entity placeholders (e.g., [ENTITY_NAME], [COMPANY_NAME]) with the SPECIFIC entity name from the provided financial data tables\n7. CRITICAL: Use the SPECIFIC entity names from the table data (e.g., 'Third-party receivables', 'Company #1') NOT the reporting entity name\n8. ALWAYS specify the exact dollar amounts and currency when filling in financial figures\n9. ALWAYS identify and mention the specific entity names you are filling in\n10. Provide a summary of key financial figures and entities used in your response\n11. IMPORTANT: When the table shows specific entity names like 'Third-party receivables', use those exact names, not the reporting entity name\n12. For tax names, use abbreviations (e.g., 'VAT' for Value Added Tax, 'CIT' for Corporate Income Tax)\n13. Check if numbers are already in K/M format - if so, use as-is; if not, convert appropriately\n14. Do not add outer quotation marks to your response",

Number format validation: Check if numbers are properly formatted (K/M notation)\n4. Content quality: Ensure no template artifacts or placeholder text remain\n5. Logical consistency: Verify that the content logically matches the financial data",
